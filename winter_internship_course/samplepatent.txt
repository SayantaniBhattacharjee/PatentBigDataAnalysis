<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a shovel. More particularly, this invention relates to a shovel that has a foot step for improved ergonomic use and a foot step that is attachable to a shovel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Shovels for excavating, such as the spade or spade shovel, which will be referred to herein as the shovel, have been known for some time. A shovel is a common tool for digging, lifting, and moving bulk materials such as soil, sand, gravel, etc. Such shovels are tools that are commonly used in construction.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most shovels are hand tools consisting of a broad blade fixed to a medium-length handle. Shovel blades are usually made of sheet steel or hard plastics and are very strong. Shovel handles are usually made of wood (especially specific varieties such as ash or maple) or glass-reinforced plastic (fibreglass).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hand shovel blades made of sheet steel usually have a folded seam or hem at the back to make a socket for the handle. This fold also commonly provides extra rigidity to the blade. The handles are usually riveted in place.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The upper edges of the blade have blade shoulders, typically consisting of a folded seam. In order to exert force on the shovel blade, a user places a foot on the blade shoulder.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to an improved shovel and step which provide enhanced ergonomic use. The shovel and step of the current invention enables excavation to be undertaken more quickly and with less stressful impact on a user's back. The inventor has appreciated that the conventional shovel only has one position on which a user places a foot to impart force on the shovel blade.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of this invention to provide a shovel and step which reduces the stressful impact on a user's back particularly when shovelling deep excavations. The shovel and step of the current invention are particularly beneficial in that the step can be positioned at an appropriate height for a user enabling improved ergonomic posture when shovelling.</p>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the step is fixed to the socket of the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the step is fixed to the shaft proximate to the blade.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the step comprises a first step flange and a second step flange, each of the first and second step flanges being oriented in plane and positioned orthogonal to the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the step is adjustable in a longitudinal direction along the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the selected distance is between 4 to 6 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, a length of the shaft is and a length of the blade is between 18 and 22 inches and a length of the shaft is between 38 and 46 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, a distance between a top of the step and the shoulder is between 4 to 6 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the shaft is made of a material selected from the group consisting of wood, carbon fibre, fiberglass and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment, the invention consists of a shovel blade having a tip at a first end and a socket at a second opposite end, a shovel shoulder on each side of the socket, a step being fixed to the socket at a selected distance from the shoulders.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, the selected distance is between 4 to 6 inches.</p>
